# AntiVirus Killer V2

# V2 Features
------------------------------------------------
Introducing New, Advanced Evasion Methods: I'm adding several new, more sophisticated techniques to the simulation, such as "ChaCha20," "API Hashing," "Direct Syscalls," and "ETW Patching," to provide a wider and more powerful arsenal of options.
Improving Existing Method Descriptions: I'll update the descriptions and tags for existing methods like "AES Encryption" and "Polymorphic Engine" to better reflect their advanced capabilities.
Enhancing Terminal Log Realism: The processing log will now output more specific and technical details for each step, making the simulation more immersive and believable. For example, it will mention specific functions being patched (AmsiScanBuffer) or techniques being used (HalosGate/Hellsgate).
Code Refinements: The underlying JavaScript simulation logic will be updated to incorporate these new methods, each with its own unique (simulated) processing time and log output.
